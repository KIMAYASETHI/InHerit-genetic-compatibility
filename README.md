# InHerit- Ethics- First Genetic Compatibility and Reproductive Health Education Platform
Educational prototype exploring genetic compatibility and health related factors
# InHerit

**InHerit** is an educational prototype designed to explore concepts related to genetic compatibility and inheritance in the context of reproductive health.

InHerit is a prototype-stage, ethics-first platform focused on genetic literacy and reproductive health education for individuals and couples.
The platform is strictly educational — it does not predict outcomes, diagnose conditions, determine fertility, or identify fetal sex. Instead, it prioritizes risk awareness, scientific humility, and informed understanding of genetics and reproductive health. Eduacting the audience for future risks and possibilities in today's modern era powered by genetics and proper planning . 

Helping the audience to create a better future and environment for the next generations.

This project was developed as part of my independent learning in genetics, bioinformatics, and computational approaches to biological problems.

## Project Overview

The goal of InHerit is to conceptually model how genetic information can be used to assess compatibility and potential inheritance-related risks.  
The platform is intended strictly for **educational and academic purposes** and does not provide medical or clinical advice.

---

## Current Status

- Prototype stage
- Core logic and workflow design completed
- User interface developed using AI assisted tools 
- Public deployment and documentation are ongoing

---

## Technologies & Tools

- AI-assisted development platform (Caffeine)
- Basic bioinformatics and genetics concepts
- Logic-based workflow design

---

## Ethical Disclaimer!

This project is intended for **educational use only**.  
It is not a diagnostic, predictive, or clinical tool and should not be used for medical decision-making.
This project is a prototype focused on ethical design and educational flow. CLINICAL VALIDATION AND DEPLOYMENT ARE OUT OF SCOPE AT THIS STAGE.

---

## Future Directions

- Code cleanup and modularization
- Integration of curated genetic datasets
- Expanded documentation
- Open-source release with community feedback

- ## App Preview

Below are some photos from the current prototype version of InHerit.

- ## Why InHerit
  
Genetics is not destiny.
Education is responsibility.
AI must respect uncertainty.
