Educational prototype exploring genetic compatibility
# InHerit

**InHerit** is an educational prototype designed to explore concepts related to genetic compatibility and inheritance in the context of reproductive health.

This project was developed as part of my independent learning in genetics, bioinformatics, and computational approaches to biological problems.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of InHerit is to conceptually model how genetic information can be used to assess compatibility and potential inheritance-related risks.  
The platform is intended strictly for **educational and academic purposes** and does not provide medical or clinical advice.

---

## Current Status

- Prototype stage
- Core logic and workflow design completed
- User interface developed using AI-assisted development tools (Caffeine)
- Public deployment and documentation are ongoing

---

## Technologies & Tools

- AI-assisted development platform (Caffeine)
- Basic bioinformatics and genetics concepts
- Logic-based workflow design

---

## Ethical Disclaimer

This project is intended for **educational use only**.  
It is not a diagnostic, predictive, or clinical tool and should not be used for medical decision-making.

---

## Future Directions

- Code cleanup and modularization
- Integration of curated genetic datasets
- Expanded documentation
- Open-source release with community feedback

- ## App Preview

Below are screenshots from the current prototype version of InHerit.
